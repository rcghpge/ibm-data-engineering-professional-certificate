Data Engineering @ NY-based Coffee Shop:

Background:
In this scenario, you have recently been hired as a Data Engineer by a New York-based coffee shop chain looking to 
expand nationally by opening several franchise locations. They want to streamline operations and revamp their data 
infrastructure as part of their expansion process.

Your job is to design their relational database systems for improved operational efficiencies and make it easier for

- Customer data output as a CSV file from a custom customer relationship management system
- Product information maintained in a spreadsheet exported from your supplier's database
